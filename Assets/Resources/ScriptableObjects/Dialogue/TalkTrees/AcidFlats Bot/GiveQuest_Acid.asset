  - text: Excellent! Be careful of the great beast that dwells deep within these caverns.
      I was beginning to construct a protocol override device to access it's chambers,
      however I was attacked and those retches absconded with my device. Those savage
      ripped it apart and ran away with the different pieces. If you find both pieces
      and bring them back, I can reconstruct it and get us access to him.

    - response: I'll do it.
