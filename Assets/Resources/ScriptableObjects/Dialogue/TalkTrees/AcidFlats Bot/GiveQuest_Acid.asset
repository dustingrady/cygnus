      I was beginning to construct a weapon to defeat it, however I was attacked and
      those retches absconded with my weapon. Those savage ripped it apart and ran
      away with the different pieces. If you find all three pieces and bring them
      back to me, I can finish constructing it and you can use it against the foul
      beast.
